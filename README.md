# HI, I'M SIMON :smiley:üññ

I'm a **multi-disciplinary** game developer into Art & STEM. I have a **technical-designer profile** with a great passion for creating systems with an **empathetic approach**.

I've studied graphic design and then in _2018_ I've graduated as a **Designer and Animator for Videogames**. Since then, I've been learning and teaching online multiple skills related to game development.
