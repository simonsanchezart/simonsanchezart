# 👋 Hi, I'm Simon — Developer & Tech Artist

I’m passionate about building tools and systems that make game development more efficient and creative. My work focuses on technical art, pipeline automation, and tool programming.

I enjoy solving complex problems through code — improving workflows, creating custom solutions, and connecting different parts of the production pipeline.
